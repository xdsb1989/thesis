1.the raw data in the files "data_set.txt" and "new_data_set.txt".

2.extract features and windowing the data into "thesis_data.txt" and "new_thesis_data.txt"

3.split the "thesis_data.txt" or the "new_thesis_data.txt" , you can get  "thesis_data-test.txt" and "thesis_data-train.txt". Training set is 2 times larger than the testing set.

4."thesis_data-attr.txt" contains the attributes which the algorithm needs.

5.Thesis_dataset.java is for step 2 above.

6.segment_split_file.java is for step 3 above.
